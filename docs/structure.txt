## Project Structure
Key Directories

app/

This is the App Router in Next.js 13+.

Contains layout.tsx (global layout), page.tsx (main route), and other folders for different routes.

Each subfolder represents a route, for example: app/dashboard/page.tsx → /dashboard.

components/

Stores all reusable UI components.

Usually includes a subfolder called components/ui/ (the shadcn/ui components).

You can also create your own folders like components/custom/ for your app-specific components.

To change how your app looks, you usually edit files in components/ui/.

hooks/

Contains custom React hooks.

Examples: useTheme(), useToast(), useMediaQuery(), useUserSession().

Used for logic that’s reusable but not UI-related.

lib/

Utility and configuration helpers.

Commonly includes helper functions (like cn()), constants, and API clients.

Example: lib/utils.ts defines helper utilities used across your components.

public/

Contains static assets (images, icons, etc.).

Anything here is publicly available at your site’s root URL (e.g. /logo.svg).

styles/

Holds your global styles (Tailwind setup).

Usually includes globals.css with @tailwind base, components, and utilities.

You can modify global theme colors, fonts, or animations here.

Configuration Files

.next/ → Build output folder (auto-generated, don’t edit manually).

next.config.mjs → Next.js configuration (images, experimental settings, etc.).

tsconfig.json → TypeScript compiler configuration and path aliases.

postcss.config.mjs → Enables Tailwind and Autoprefixer.

components.json → Configuration file for shadcn/ui component generator.

package.json → Lists dependencies and scripts.

.gitignore → Specifies which files Git should ignore (node_modules, .next, etc.).
